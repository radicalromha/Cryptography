# Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and data from unauthorized access or tampering. It involves the use of mathematical algorithms and protocols to encode information in a way that makes it difficult for anyone to access or modify it without the proper credentials.Some common techniques used in cryptography include encryption, which involves encoding data so that it can only be accessed by someone with the proper decryption key, and authentication, which involves verifying the identity of a person or device. Cryptography is an important tool for protecting data and maintaining privacy in the digital age.
